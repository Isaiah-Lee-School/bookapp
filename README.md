This is a web application that allows users to track their reading. Users can add books to their account with specific stats such as a rating out of 10, and the date they finished reading the book.
User authentication is fully implemented. More features are on the way, including friends (which is almost ready), groups, and a chat feature.
- User Authentication using PHP sessions
- Dynamic one page application once signed in via JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Database designed and properly normalized to avoid data anomalies.
- Will include friends, with the ability to view the common readings between friends.
- Will include groups, where everyone reads the same book and discusses their thoughts.
- Will include a chat feature between friends and groups
